##WS-DREAM

WS-DREAM is a package of open source-code and datasets to benchmark QoS-driven services research, especially on Web service recommendation.

With both datasets and source code publicly released, WS-DREAM repository would allow ease of reproducing the existing approaches, and potentially inspires more research efforts in this area. Specifically, for future research on QoS prediction of Web services, you do not need to write your own program from scratch. The WS-DREAM framework can be easily extended to new implementations. This is exactly the goal of maintaining this repository.

##Dependencies
- Python 2.7 (https://www.python.org)
- Cython 0.20.1 (http://cython.org)
- numpy 1.8.1 (http://www.scipy.org)

##Usage

The algorithms in WS-DREAM are mostly implemented in C++ and further wrapped up as a python package for common use.

1. Install `wsdream` package
    
  Download the repo at: https://github.com/wsdream/WS-DREAM/tarball/master,
  
  then install the package `python setup.py install --user`. 

2. Change directory `cd` to `"benchmarks/"`, and configure the parameters in benchmark scripts
  
  For example, in `run_rt.py`, you can config the `'parallelMode': True` if you are running a multi-core machine. You can also set `'rounds': 1` for testing, which can make the execution finish soon.

3. Read `"readme.txt"` for each appraoch, and execute the provided benchmark scripts 
    
	```
    $ python run_rt.py
    $ python run_tp.py 
    ```
4. Check the evaluation results in `"result/"` directory. Note that the repository has maintained the results evaluated on [WS-DREAM datasets](https://github.com/wsdream/dataset), which are ready for immediate use.
